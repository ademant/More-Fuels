More-Fuels is a mod adds a few new fuels for use in furnaces and vehicles.
The oil can (not the oil bucket) is only added when Technic is installed, though it isnt necessary, its only added to be more realistic.

Note that compatibility with the Hidroplane, Motorboat, and Trike are complete.

### Fuels Added
* gasoline
* oil/pertrolium
* diesil
### WIP Fuels
* propane
* methane
* hydrogen
* coke
* butane

##### Code Inspectors:
say thanks to Techdude, he was the one to organize this mod into multiple, easily readable/editable, files.(something of which I am apperantly incapable)
